# KHub Dark Mode
A dark mode userscript for PSHS KHub.


# Installation Guide

1. Install a userscript runner on your browser. Preferably you can use Tampermonkey (the one I use), with the installation for it located [here](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
2. Go to the [userscript](https://github.com/JaSonic4PSHSMC/pshsdarkmode/blob/main/khubdarkmode.user.js), press RAW, and press install.
3. Enjoy!

NOTE: The userscript apparently (sometimes) hates math. Go to [this video](https://youtu.be/NsKCpd5a09Q) for a quick fix for it. Thanks!

NOTE^2: This guide is outdated as of August 21, 2023, although it still works.
