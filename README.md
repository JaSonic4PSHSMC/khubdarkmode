# pshsdarkmode
A dark mode userscript for PSHS KHub.

# Installation Guide

1. Install a userscript runner on your browser. Preferably you can use Tampermonkey (the one I use), with the installation for it located [here](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
2. Install the userscript onto your device by pressing the download button [here](https://github.com/JaSonic4PSHSMC/pshsdarkmode/blob/main/khubdarkmode.user.js).
3. Run the userscript (dont worry, there is no malware on it) and install the file.
4. Enjoy!

NOTE: The userscript apparently hates math. Go to [this video](https://youtu.be/NsKCpd5a09Q) for a quick fix for it. Thanks!
